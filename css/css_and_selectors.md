## Pseudo Selectors

Pseudo selecting is a css element selection method that involves the `colon (:)` syntax.

IE)

```css
h1:hover,
h1:active {
  color: red;
}
```

We need to ensure that the order of our pseudo selectors flow the `LVHA` naming order break down:

- `:link`

- `:visited`

- `:hover`

- `:active`

There are more selectors that allow us to target the children of a particular parent element:

```css
/* FIRST CHILD */
li:first-child {
  /* This will provide styling for the first child of a list */
}

/* LAST CHILD */
li:last-child {
  /* This will provide styling for the last child of a list */
}

/* ONLY CHILD */
li:only-child {
  /* This will provide styling for the only child of a parent */
}
```

The outlier pseudo selector here is the `Nth-child` selector. This selector will allow us to use the nth value and style whatever combination of numbers we wish to out there.

We can also provide preset values for selecting all odd and even numbers and we can also use it to select a single element.

EG)

```css
li:nth-child(odd) {
  /* This will add the styles to all odd children under the parent */
}

li:nth-child(even) {
  /* This will add the styles to all even children under the parent */
}

li:nth-child(2) {
  /* This will add the styles to the second child under the parent li */
}
```

If you want to use the undefined variable n to create a sequence selector for values that meet the criteria we can use the following. (Remember this `n` variable allows us to use basic math to select our children)

EG)

```css
li:nth-child(2n) {
  /* This will style all even children, just like the key word even would */
}

and li:nth-child(2n + 1) {
  color: red; /* For odd children styling */
}
```

IE)

### Selector best practices

1. Use type selectors when all or most instances of an HTML element needs to be styled in the same manner. `(h1)`

2. Use class names as a way to select elements in more specific groups for reusability and flexibility as apposed to type selectors. `(.class-name)`

3. Use IDs for uniquely appearing elements that are not duplicated across the application. `(#id-for-element)`

4. When using descendent selectors do not go more then 3 levels deep. IE)

```scss
âˆš Acceptable 
div .red-letters {
  color: red;
}

X Not Acceptable 
div .red-letters h3 p {
  color: red;
}

// This slows down your style resolution and makes your code messy and unreadable.
```

<br />

#### There are more pseudo selectors like `:before` and `:after` that are used to insert styles and html code (text) into a position that is relative to the element selected.

For example if we did this:

```html
<div class="article">
  <p>I love CSS. Do you?</p>
</div>
```

```css
.article:before {
  content: "Yes, I do";
}

.article:after {
  content: "No, I don't";
}

/* Will result in */

-> Yes, I do I love CSS. Do you? No, I don't
```

**NOTE:** If you use `:before OR :after` you MUST specify a content value even if no content is going to be added -> IE):

```css
.article:before {
    content: ''
}
```

**NOTE:** <font color=red>When you use these pseudo elements they are not appended to the DOM they are just visually displayed, so do not rely on them or use them for content that is important use this for styling and adding cool animations and features to your HTML elements rather</font>

<br />

Another type of selector to keep in mind are `Attribute` selectors and these can select elements based on any criteria. They are super useful when you want to be very detailed or creative with your selections of elements.

<br />

**NOTE:** Browsers do have their own styling for elements so we need to ensure we either override those styles or create a style reset file where we can set all of the default preset for our application.

## Cascades In CSS

The Cascades in CSS (cascading style sheet) comes from the concept of cascading. ***This concept shares similarities with inheritance***

In short ***inheritance*** applies to DOM nodes and them inheriting from the relationships, think Parent child relationships for HTML elements.

The ***Cascade*** Is about the relationship between multiple stylesheets.

*This can be annoying. If you have multiple style sheets this means that the styles defined in one will be passed down to all other style sheets. (The styles cascade/fall down from one sheet to another)*

<font color=lightgreen>In even shorter: The fact that multiple stylesheets can affect the same document revolves around the concept of cascade in CSS. Think the ability for the browser to already have default styles and us creating our own style sheet to override those styles. This is as example of 2 stylesheets effecting the same DOM application. This is `Cascading`!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</font>

<br />

Ordering of our style declarations matter, if you place conflicting styles together the last style declared will take prescidance. 

IE)

```css
/** Initial styling */
h1 {
  color: black
}

/** MORE STYLES */
/** ... */
/** ... */

/** Override */
h1 {
  color: red; /** This style will override the style that was defined higher up in the style sheet */
}
```

When working with the ordering of styles it's also important to understand that the specificity of your selectors also determine their hierarchy and determine which style will be the one that is used for example:

```css
header h1 {
  color: red;
}

h1 {
  color: blue;
}

```
-> Although the header h1 falls in with the h1 selector from the second style declaration we will have our h1 be coloured red since the specificity of the `header h1` selector is greater then that of the `h1` selector.

You can think of these selectors being given points.

Here is this arbitrary points system and how it determines which styles take presidents over others.
