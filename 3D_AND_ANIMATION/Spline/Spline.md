# Spline

Spline is a standalone application for creating 3D designs and animation. It provides its own interface for creating animation which is a non code based and <font color=magenta>thus cannot be used with GSAP scrolling animation to scrub the animation</font>. 

**_However, Spline has it's own object states (glorified variables) that allow you to toggle interactions in your animation scene. It also has it's own events that can be used to trigger animations in the animation scene. For example we can do a tap to play animation on certain part of the animation or scrub an animation on scroll. This cannot be as CUSTOMIZED as the ThreeJS and GSAP solution would be._**

<br />

Under the hood it renders WebGL content that uses JS APIs for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. This tool allow for easy creation of overlay 3D animations and 3D scenes for viewing objects in different dimensions and could be used to create AR and VR web assets and scenes.

Spline allows you to export your design created in their no code editor as self-contained web-ready files, which can be easily embedded in a web application.

On The other hand

Spline allows us to have state, controls and triggers for our 3D animations. 

Here is an example of us using the scroll control trigger and mouse positioning to animate our animation scene.

Here is an example of how we can use keyboard controls for our 3D scenes within our application. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYp_ipIasYE&t=308s)
