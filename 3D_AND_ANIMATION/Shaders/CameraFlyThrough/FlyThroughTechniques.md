# Camera Fly-Through (Infinite Runner)

The technique of continuously moving the camera forward through a 3D scene or across a terrain or plane is commonly known as "Camera Fly-Through" or, in the context of games, an "Infinite Runner" mechanic. 

<font color=gold>This approach can be used to create the illusion of endless movement through a space, such as flying through a landscape or running along a path that continuously unfolds.</font> 

It is often combined with procedural generation techniques to dynamically create new terrain, obstacles, and scenery as the camera advances, ensuring that the environment remains engaging and unpredictable. 

This method is versatile and can be implemented with various rendering techniques, including Ray Marching, Ray Casting, and traditional polygon-based rendering, depending on the desired visual style and performance considerations.
