# Procedural Generation Techniques

Procedural generation techniques can greatly enhance the experience of a camera fly-through in a 3D scene by dynamically creating content, ensuring that the environment remains engaging and seemingly infinite with fresh new created landscapes for exploration.

This will offer unique visual experiences for each users session.

This technique is often used in computer graphics, game development, and simulation to generate complex structures and environments that would be impractical or time-consuming to create manually.

<font color=cyan>The key benefit of procedural generation is that it is efficient in creating large and complex environments without requiring extensive storage space. `Since the content is generated on the fly based on algorithms, it can significantly reduce the need for manual asset creation and storage allowing for more expansive and detailed virtual worlds`.</font>

### Procedural Generation + [Camera Fly Through](../CameraFlyThrough/FlyThroughTechniques.md)

<font color=gold>When these 2 techniques are combined together we can create immersive environments, since we can dynamically generate environments as the camera moves around. This creates an infinite or continually fresh landscape for exploration.</font>

Here are some procedural generation techniques that are commonly used:

## Perlin Noise and Simplex Noise

Application: These gradient noise functions are used for generating natural-looking textures, terrains, and landscapes. They can create varied yet coherent structures like mountains, clouds, and waves, making them ideal for endless terrains in fly-throughs.

[Here is an example of perlin noise generated within a shader](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/HpSIsA8Zz)

These noise function create numbers that are not completely random but are related to each other in a way that creates a smooth, coherent pattern. By relating the randomly generated values based on nearby values leading to a more natural and visually appealing result.

## Voronoi Diagrams

Application: Useful for creating procedurally generated maps, terrains, and biomes. Voronoi diagrams can simulate regions or cells with different properties (e.g., elevation, moisture) to create diverse ecosystems.

## Fractal Algorithms

Application: Fractals can generate complex, self-similar patterns and structures, such as trees, coastlines, and mountains. Techniques like the Mandelbrot set or fractal noise algorithms can create endlessly intricate scenes.

## Agent-Based Systems

Application: Systems where multiple agents (simple entities with their own set of rules) interact with each other and the environment to create complex patterns and structures, such as road networks, city layouts, or cave systems.

## L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems)

Application: A mathematical system used to model the growth processes of plants, trees, and other natural phenomena. L-Systems are great for creating intricate and varied vegetation procedurally.

## Cellular Automata

Application: Techniques like Conway's Game of Life can be used to generate complex patterns from simple rules. This can be applied to simulate phenomena like fire spread, water flow, or even urban growth.

## Wave Function Collapse (WFC)

Application: A relatively new algorithm used for texture generation and tiling problems. It's useful for generating coherent and diverse patterns based on a small set of rules and sample modules, ideal for creating varied structures and landscapes.

## Graph-Based Techniques

Application: Used for generating road networks, dungeons, and other interconnected structures. Graph algorithms can ensure that generated environments are navigable and interconnected, enhancing the exploration experience in a fly-through.

## Procedural Rule-Based Object Placement

Application: Defines rules for placing objects (trees, buildings, rocks) within the scene based on terrain features, ensuring logical and visually appealing distributions.

These techniques can be combined and tailored to fit the specific needs and aesthetics of the 3D scene, creating a unique and immersive camera fly-through experience.
