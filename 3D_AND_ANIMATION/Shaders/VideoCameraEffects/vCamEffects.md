# Video Camera Effects

These are effects that will be created by piping the video camera feed data and supplying it to a mutation function to perform the effect and output the effect to a canvas in an application.

If we want to take this one step further. We can create the shader and run it on local host and screen share the local host. OR [We can use cam twist to switch out our main webcam feed with the video feed from our local desktop screen share so that you don't even need to share your screen on applications like zoom, google meets, team, etc... Linked is an example of how this can be accomplished.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmWzMmebqPY)
